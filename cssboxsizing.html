    <h1>Without CSS box sizing property</h1>
    <p>By default widht and height of an element is calculated as follows</p>
    <ul>
        <li>width + padding + border = actual width of an element</li>
        <li>height + padding + border = actual height of an element</li>
        <li>This means: When you set the width/height of an element, the element often appears bigger than you have set (because the element's border and padding are added to the element's specified width/height).</li>
        <li>We have set width as 200px and height as 100px but since we are not using box sizing property the total width becomes 250px and total height becomes 150px</li>
        <li>Bellow is an illustration</li>
    </ul>

    <div id="div1">
        <p>I am a div not using box sizing property and my height and width is set to 300px and 100px respectively.And I look greater than my dimensions
        </p>
    </div>

    <h1>With CSS box sizing property</h1>
    <p>The box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you set box-sizing: border-box; on an element, padding and border are included in the width and height:</li>
        <li>We have set width as 200px and height as 200px but since we are using box sizing property the total width remains 20px and total height remains 100px</li>
        <li>Bellow is an illustration</li>
    </ul>

    <div id="div2">
        <p>I am a div using box sizing property and my height and width is set to 200px and 200px respectively.And I look exact as my dimensions</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Since the result of using the box-sizing: border-box; is so much better, many developers want all elements on their pages to work this way.
        So they use *{box-sizing:border-box};
    </h2>
